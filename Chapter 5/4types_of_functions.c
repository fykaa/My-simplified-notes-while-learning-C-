/*Types of Functions:

    Library functions: Commonly required functions grouped together in a library file on disk.          //like printf, rand(), from predeffined library
    User-defined functions: These are the functions declared and defined by the user.                   //like goodmorning, display jo hamne banaaya

Why use functions?
    To avoid rewriting the same logic again and again
    To keep track of what we are doing in a program
    To test and check logic independently
