/* Types of Files
There are two types of files:

Text files(.txt, .c)
Binary files(.jpg, .dat)

@it is not necessary ki if extension is .txt then vo sirf Text file hoga, it could happen that uske andar bhi unreadable data ho similarly
    not necessary every jpg or dat is a Binary file it may be readable

@to distinguish between text and binary file, open that file in any notepad or vsc, if it has written content and is readable then it is text file, 
    and if it has a lot of symbols, and unreadable junks like symbols faces and no sequence then it is a binary file.

@most of the cases sahi naming hoti hai .txt ki, but there can be a possibility ki a txt named file is binary

@a BINARY  file CAnt be read using Any text editor!
