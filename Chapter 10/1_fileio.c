Chapter 10 - File I/O


The random access memory is volatile and its content is lost once the program terminates. In order to persist the data forever, we use files.

A file data stored in a storage device. A C program can talk to the file by reading content from it and writing content to it.

            --->write
c program               File
            read<---


@ram is expensive, hence pc has less ram and program isme pehle load hoti hai vha read hoti hai, 
        so when any programm is to be run it is stored in the ram , 
        but agar aapke paas bohat saara data hai, to ek time ke baad prgram crash hojayega or os will kill the process
