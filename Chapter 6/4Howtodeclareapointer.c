/*How to declare a pointer?
A pointer is declared using the following syntax,
    int *j;            => declare a variable j of type int-pointer
    j= &i              => store address of i in j

Just like pointer in type-integer, we also have pointers to char, float, etc.
    int *ch_ptr;       => pointer to integer

    char *ch_ptr;      => pointer to character

    float *ch_ptr      => pointer to float
here ch_ptr is just a name hence ye mat socho ki character ko integer mein store krrahe h, name of variable se farak nahi padhta
Although it's a good practice to use meaningful variable names, we should be very careful while reading & working on programs from fellow programmers.
