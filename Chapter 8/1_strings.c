/*Chapter 8 - Strings
A string is a 1-d character array terminated by a null(‘\0’) => {this is null character}

The null character is used to denote string termination, characters are stored in contiguous memory locations.

Initializing Strings
Since string is an array of characters, it can be initialized as follows:

char s[]={‘H’,’A’,’R’,’R’,’Y’,’\0’}
There is another shortcut for initializing strings in c language:

char s[]="HARRY";    => In this case C adds a null character automatically.
