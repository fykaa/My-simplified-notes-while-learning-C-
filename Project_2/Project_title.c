/*Project 2: Snake, Water, Gun

Snake, Water, Gun or Rock, Paper, Scissors is a game most of us have played during school time. (I sometimes play it even now :))


Write a C program capable of playing this game with you.
Your program should be able to print the result after you choose Snake/Water or Gun.
