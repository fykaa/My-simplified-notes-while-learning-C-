// Chapter 4 - Loop Control Instruction

    // Why loops?
    // Sometimes we want our programs to execute a few sets of instructions over and over again, for eg. Printing 1 to 100, first 100 even numbers, etc.

    // Hence loops make it easy for a programmer to tell the computer that a given set of instructions must be executed repeatedly.

        // 1.While loop

        // 2.do-while loop

        // 3.for loop
