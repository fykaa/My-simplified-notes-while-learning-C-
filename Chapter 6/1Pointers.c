/* Chapter 6 - Pointers
 A pointer is a variable that stores the address of another variable.(--address of memory)
i-72-adress;87994
j-87994-adress;87998
here,
j is a pointer
j points to i.


//@ by me:
pointer is storing address 
pointer is one of the most important parts of programming BECAUSE
pointers are IMPORTANTLY used for doing CALL by REFERENCE 
i.e.you can change value of a variable in main function , through an recursion function ONLY by using pointers!, beccause in CALL by value you cant change the variable in main through external functions;
this is because in cbv you pass on the xerox copy of original variable in the main, hence external function cant change the origianl value.
but in cbr you pass the address of original (using pointers) due to which external functions can make changes to main function ka variable.
